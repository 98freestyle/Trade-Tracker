# READAI.md - Trade Tracker Project

## What We're Building

A professional trade tracking web application that's way better than Excel for monitoring stock trading performance.

## The Problem
- User tracks trades in Excel which is annoying and clunky
- Hard to see real trading performance vs account balance (includes deposits)
- No mobile access
- Manual calculations for win rate, P&L, etc.
- Can't access across devices

## The Solution
Full-stack web application with:
- **Beautiful React frontend** - clean, modern, candy eye interface
- **Python FastAPI backend** - handles user accounts, database, API
- **Real-time calculations** - win rate, true profit vs deposits, statistics
- **Mobile responsive** - works on phone as PWA
- **Data persistence** - never lose your trading history

## Current Trade Tracking Style
User currently tracks in Excel with columns:
- Buy Date, Ticker, Buy Price, Sell Price, Total Cost, Shares
- Profit/Loss ($), Profit/Loss (%), Sell Date, Notes, Brokerage

**Current performance:** $5539.34 account value, $5500 deposited = $39.34 profit (barely breakeven after 3 months)

## Key Features

### 1. Trade Entry
- Quick form to add trades (symbol, entry/exit dates, prices, shares)
- Notes field for lessons learned
- Auto-calculate P&L, percentages

### 2. Deposit Tracking  
- Track money added to account over time
- Separate trading performance from new money deposits
- See true trading profit vs total account balance

### 3. Dashboard Analytics
- **True Trading Performance:** Total deposited vs current value
- **Win Rate:** Percentage of profitable trades
- **Average R:R:** Risk/reward ratio
- **Best/Worst Trades:** Top performers and biggest losses
- **Monthly Performance:** Track progress over time
- **Current Stats:** Trades this month, total trades, etc.

### 4. User Experience
- **Try Before Account:** Users can test the app immediately
- **Progressive Commitment:** Only ask for account after they've used it
- **Mobile Access:** Works as PWA on phone
- **Beautiful Design:** Big bold numbers, clean interface, modern styling

### Database Schema

**Users Table:**
- id, email, hashed_password, created_at

**Trades Table:**
- id, user_id, symbol, entry_date, exit_date
- entry_price, exit_price, shares, notes
- profit_loss, profit_loss_percent, created_at

**Deposits Table:**
- id, user_id, amount, date, notes, created_at

## User Flow

### 1. Trial Experience (No Account)
- User visits website
- Can immediately start adding trades
- Data saves temporarily (localStorage)
- Full functionality to test the app
- Dashboard shows all analytics

### 2. Account Creation
- After using app, prompt: "Want to save this data forever and sync across devices?"
- Simple signup (email + password)
- Uploads localStorage data to backend
- Now data syncs across devices

### 3. Daily Usage
- Quick trade entry on desktop
- Check performance on phone
- Monthly analytics review
- Clean interface, fast workflows

## Key Calculations

### True Trading Performance
```
Total Deposited: $5500
Current Account Value: $5539.34
True Trading Profit: $39.34 (0.7% return)
```

### Analytics Metrics
- **Win Rate:** (Winning Trades / Total Trades) × 100
- **Average Win:** Sum of profits / Number of winning trades  
- **Average Loss:** Sum of losses / Number of losing trades
- **Risk/Reward Ratio:** Average Win / Average Loss
- **Monthly Return:** This month's P&L / Account value start of month
